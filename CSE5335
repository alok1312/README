Answers to the question 5:

(a) I used Ruby on rails as a server framework because it allows to write less code than many oter language and frameworks.
(b) I used jQuery as a client framework because jQuery simplifies the use of javascript and I found it easier to use with ajax.
(c) I found that creating rails application was easy. It makes the most of the folder which makes the web programming easier.
(d) Configuring the route in rails application was little difficult for me. I got confused how to configure the routes.
(e) I installed the ide RubyMine 7.0, curl for rvm, 
(f) The commands required to deploy and run the server are :
 		- $ sudo apt-get install ruby
		- $ gem install rails
		- $ bundle install
		- $ rails new app
		- $ cd app
		- $ rails s/rails server

Steps to start the projects: 

Step1: Install the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on VMWARE Workstation 11.
Step2: Install the ruby on Ubuntu.
Step3: Install rvm to update the ruby.
Step4: Updated the ruby using rvm (Ruby 2.1.5)
Step5: Install rails using the 'gem install' commands provided by RubyGems.

Step9: (a) Integrated facebook graph API with rails application.
       (b) Used two gems (omniauth-facebook and koala) to integrate the API.
       (c) Omniauth-facebook is used for authentication such to get the permisssion from user to get their facebook profile.
       (d) Koala is used for fetching the data.
       (e) to update these two gems in gemfile use the command (bundle install).
       
Step10: Go to the folder where alok application was created using terminal.
Step11: created the controller users index
Step12: Put the facebook API code in the folders such as views, model, and config of the application.
Step13: Put the jquery code in /views/index.html.erb
Step14: Run rails server
Step15: Go to the browser put http://localhost:300
Step16: jQuery will call the function ajax load function which will fetch the json data from the Restful facebook graph API.
Step17: API will return the three json objects (Name, Picture, and Gender).
